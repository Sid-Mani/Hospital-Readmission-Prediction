# Hospital-Readmission-Prediction
This repo contains the Jupyter Notebook for predicting hospital readmission for patients with diabetes
The dataset was taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository :https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008

.Performed EDA(Explanatory Data Analysis) and applied feature engineering and feature selection
.Built Decision Tree, Random Forest and Logistic classifiers in python using Scikit-Learn to predict which patients might be readmitted to the hospital.
.Applied cross validation on the training data to select the best parameters of the model.
.Determined the modelâ€™s performance by comparing recall and precision on test data to choose the best Machine Learning Algorithm.
